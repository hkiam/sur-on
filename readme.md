# Sur-Ron Hacks

## Overview
This project is about hacks for Sur-Ron electric motorcycles. 
In the current version, the focus is still on the Light Bee, but depending on the availability of another vehicle, I may expand it ;)

## What's here so far?
So far I have been working with the original speedometer and can read out, change and reload the firmware. First example adaptations are available.
