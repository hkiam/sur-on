# Sur-Ron Hacks

## Overview
This project is about hacks for Sur-Ron electric motorcycles. 
In the current version, the focus is still on the Light Bee, but depending on the availability of another vehicle, I may expand it ;)

## What's here so far?
So far I have been working with the original speedometer and can read out, change and reload the firmware. First example adaptations are available.

## Next Challenge

Is reading out the controller firmware and, if necessary, a software mod. However, the project is still at a very early stage and the feasibility with reasonable effort has not been clarified.
